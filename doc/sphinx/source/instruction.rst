Hello world!
------------

This is my first *instruction*.

Let's look at annotation for `SmartPtr` class:

.. doxygenclass:: SmartPtr
    :members:

Now you can describe applications, or even provide some examples::

    {
        SmartPtr<double> dptr(new double(1.278);
        # memory will be cleaned here
    }

Hope you'll find it funny.
